            <h2 class="text-center">A Record (IPv4) [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035">RFC1035</a>]</h2>
            <p>
                A records are one of first record types defined are were given type code 1.
                A records map a domain name to IPv4 address.
                The record contains only one address and this is the only field.
                Hosts that have multiple Internet addresses will have multiple A records.
                A records cause no additional section processing.
                IPv4 address are expressed in zone files using the dotted notation (192.0.2.1).
            </p>
            <pre>example.com.   IN  A 192.0.2.1</pre>
            <h2 class="text-center">AAAA Record (IPv6) [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596">RFC3596</a>]</h2>
            <p>
                AAAA records were defined to map domain names to IPv6 addresses.
                They were given type code 28.
                As with A records, AAAA records contain only one address and this is the only field.
                AAAA records cause no additional section processing.
                IPv6 address are expressed in zone files using the IPv6 compressed notation (2001:db8::0).
            </p>
            <pre>example.com.   IN  AAAA 2001:db8::0</pre>
            <h2 class="text-center"><b class="text-danger">DEPRECIATED</b> A6 Record (IPv6) [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2874">RFC2874</a>]</h2>
            <p>
                A6 records were defined to map domains to IPv6 addresses.
                These records were proposed but never made it to production and were replaced by AAAA records.
                The pros and cons were debated in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3364">RFC3364</a>.
                A6 records are not supported and should not be used.
                This record type is documented here for interests sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                A6 records were given type code 38.
                A6 differs from AAAA because it stores incomplete IPv6 addresses.
                A6 records are composed of three parts: a prefix length (unsinged 8bit integer), a complete or partial IPv6 address, and a domain name for use in obtaining the network prefix.
                A6 records can contain a complete address meaning the prefix length is 0 and there is no domain name.
                A6 records can also contain a partial address.
                A partial address for a host would contain the hosts identifier within the subnet (the network or subnet portion would be set to zero and ignored).
                In a partial address a the prefix length defines how many bits of the network portion are ommitted.
                The domain name specified is then used to make another query to obtain the network portion.
                The second query may result in a record with a shorter prefix and a third domain name.
                The chain can be used build a complete record.
            </p>
            <pre>host12.example.com. IN A6 64 ::1234:5678:9ABC:DEF0 subnet31.example.com ;partial address with the interface ID for host12
subnet31.example.com. IN A6 48 0:0:0:31:: subscriber-example.isp.net ;another partial address with the subnet id for subnet 31

subscriber-example.isp.net IN A6 32 0:0:1234:5678:: isp.ip-registry.net ;partial address showing the isp allocation to the customer
isp.ip-registry.net IN A6 0 2345:000E:: ;this is the final record with no domain name and a prefix of 0</pre>
            <p>
                The example above shows how a client can query for the IPv6 record of host12.example.com.
                The initial query will give it the last 64 bits (commonly known as the interface ID) of the IPv6 address.
                It will also get the domain name pointing to the A6 record for the subnet.
                This query returns an address with a prefix of 48.
                However, since we have already obtained the last 64 bits we ignore these bits in the second record and only record the new 16 bits.
                We will then perform a third query and obtain another 16 bits that is added on to the beginning of the address.
                The fourth query will return the final prefix and allows us to complete the IPv6 address.
                This record system is more complicated but allows for greater flexibility when creating the zone files by seperating the subnet from the interface id.
